need to include current dipoles, then run ~15 s sim with 3 Hz stimulation to thalamus
with strong/weak stimuli ... record all the current dipoles and the 3D locations ... 

before making additions, try compile/run

model code is in sim subdirectory, mod files in mod

cd sim
nrnivmodl mod

...

Successfully created x86_64/special

usage described in sim/init.py

Starting script to run NetPyNE-basedS1 model.

Usage:
    python init.py # Run simulation, optionally plot a raster

MPI usage:
    mpiexec -n 4 nrniv -python -mpi init.py

change duration to 1 s (set in cfg.py)

try with 30 cores first ... and 300 ms

mpiexec -n 30 nrniv -python -mpi init.py
